# Changelog

All notable changes to the Codex package are documented here.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-19

### Changed
- Vendored upstream ARS from `74413a42571867abece7b8b76f7a24ac472ab2a0` (`v3.9.0`) to `96b82e82142dc95f117595c207d3e150b078e411` (`v3.9.4.2`).
- Added ARS v3.9.1 client hardening, v3.9.2 phase-boundary routing discipline, v3.9.3 shared client utilities, and v3.9.4/v3.9.4.1 temporal verification runtime content.
- Kept Codex-specific overlays: single root router skill, `WORKFLOW.md` vendored workflow entry files, Codex setup/architecture docs, nested-path lint patches, and macOS Bash 3.2 audit wrapper compatibility.

### Notes
- Upstream v3.9.4.2 changes only `.github` CI/release-gate files, which are intentionally excluded from this Codex package. The manifest still pins the exact v3.9.4.2 commit for provenance.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- Aligned the Codex package with upstream ARS `v3.9.0`.
